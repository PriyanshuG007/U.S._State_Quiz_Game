# U.S._State_Quiz_Application

Overview:
The U.S. State Quiz Game is an interactive application built using Python and the Turtle module. The game tests your knowledge of U.S. states by asking you to name as many states as you can. The correct states are marked on a U.S. map, and the game keeps track of your progress. If you exit the game before naming all 50 states, a list of states you missed is saved to a file for you to review later.

Features:
1. Interactive Map: Displays a map of the United States where correct answers are marked.
2. Progress Tracking: Keeps track of the number of correctly identified states.
3. Save Progress: Saves a list of states to learn if you exit before completing the game.
4. Simple Interface: Easy-to-use text input for answering state names.
